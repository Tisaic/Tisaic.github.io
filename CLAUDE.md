# CLAUDE.md

Project context and working notes for `Tisaic.github.io`. This file is
rendered in-app by the **CLAUDE.md** button so the current state can be
reviewed from a phone.

## What this project is

A single-page static site hosted on **GitHub Pages** at
`https://tisaic.github.io`, used as a sandbox for a **browser-driven testing
workflow**: iterate on the page from Claude Code, view it in Android Chrome,
and feed console output back to Claude.

## Deploy model

- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages, served from the **`main`** branch, root.
- **Workflow:** changes are committed and pushed **directly to `main`** (the
  owner authorized skipping PRs/review for this repo).
- **`.nojekyll`** is present so Pages serves files as-is (no Jekyll
  processing), which lets the app fetch raw `.md` files at runtime.

## Verification (required before every push)

**No change ships unverified.** Before committing and pushing, every change
must be:

1. **Verified** — run the smoke test (`./test/run.sh`). It serves the repo the
   way Pages does and drives it in a mobile-emulated Chromium. All checks must
   pass (exit 0) with **zero uncaught page errors**. Static-parse the inline
   scripts too (the `node -e` vm check) so a syntax error can't ship.
2. **Scrutinized** — re-read the actual diff. Confirm nothing unintended was
   touched, no dead references were left behind, and the console bootstrap
   stays first and dependency-free.
3. **Visually analyzed** — open the screenshots in `test/screenshots/`
   (`01-home`, `02-console`, `03-docs`) and actually look at them. Layout,
   spacing, colors, and rendered content must look right on a phone-sized
   viewport, not just pass assertions.

If any step fails, fix it first — do not push. Run `stamp-version.sh` last so
the shipped commit carries the correct version.

### What `./test/run.sh` actually runs

`--quick` (the default) and `--full` choose the tier; anything pinning a CONTRACT runs in
both, and long sweeps, convergence studies and parity runs are `--full` only. Run `--full`
before pushing anything that touches a solver, a collision operator, a boundary or a
library default.

**It is FOCUSED by default.** `FOCUS` defaults to `flexisim`, so a plain run exercises the
FlexiSim area and nothing else. `--all` runs every area; `--only=ngrc,flowsim` selects
explicitly; `FOCUS= ./test/run.sh` clears the default. **Run `--all --full` before pushing
anything shared** — `lib/lattsim`, `lib/ngrc`, `console-boot.js` — or the areas that
depend on it are not being tested at all.

The tier split and the focus default drift, and drift silently, because a shorter suite
looks like a faster one. Both have been re-measured and cut before; the record is in
`docs/history/`.

## THE RULES

Each of these cost at least one defect that shipped, and several cost the same defect
three or four times in different costumes. They are the reason this file exists. The
measurement behind each is in `docs/history/` — the pointer in brackets.

### Verification

1. **Verify by the cheapest route that can actually falsify the claim.** Plain Node
   against the CPU reference (f64, seconds) → the browser on the CPU backend → the
   software adapter, only for shader compilation, CPU/GPU parity and WebGPU resource
   behaviour → a real device for anything involving a surface. When a check moves down
   that list, say what the lower tier can no longer see. [flowsim]
2. **A check too slow to be run is a verification problem, not an inconvenience.** Shrink
   it against the assertion's own margin, MEASURED not guessed — resolution is nearly
   always a cost knob and not a physics one — and say in the comment why that does not
   weaken it. [flowsim]
3. **A flaky check is a bug report, not a red line to tolerate.** A red suite hides the
   next real failure. Three times here an intermittent failure was a real defect.
4. **A failing check can be stale in EITHER direction** — the code got better, or the
   check froze one moment's number. Assert the PROPERTY against the machine's own
   reported limits, never a hard-coded ceiling. [flowsim]
5. **Assert geometry, not presence.** An element can exist, report "visible", and be off
   the screen. A canvas can be painted and show the wrong picture. A chart can be created
   at 700px inside a 388px box. Measure the box.
6. **The commonest defect class here is: no error, nothing blank, just the wrong
   picture.** Look at the screenshots every time. Where two views show one quantity,
   assert they AGREE — that is what proved the chart right and the stage wrong, and its
   absence is what let a 1.44x error in the chain's tool error survive.
7. **Neither Playwright's `pageerror` nor a console listener reports unhandled
   rejections.** Assert the page's OWN error buffer, and clear it on open: it is per
   ORIGIN, not per page. [flowsim]
8. **A conservation law that would still pass with the physics removed is not a check.**
   Remove the term and record the drift. [flexisim]
9. **Assert BOTH halves.** A one-sided claim that any weak version satisfies has no
   teeth: the learner wins where the hand model is wrong AND costs 30% where it is exact;
   the guard fires when it should AND not when it should not; the quiet detector
   terminates on a noisy machine AND refuses to call a still-settling one quiet.
10. **A rate beats an absolute number.** An absolute error can be a coincidence; a
    convergence rate cannot. Assert AT LEAST the order you can support. [flexisim]
11. **A test must drive the machine with the command it tells the model about.** The
    black box's flagship plant was handed a modulated reference and driven from an
    unmodulated one for months, so the anti-overfit protection was inactive and the
    headline was 28% too high. [flexisim]

### Measurement

12. **Read the meter after it settles.** Recorded six times: a mid-session fault two moves
    in, a dither sized from a changeover transient, a closed loop scored after one move
    instead of five, a "converged" cantilever, a compare table read a third full, a decay
    fitted from an unsettled start.
13. **A measurement taken across a transient describes the transient.** That applies to
    calibration and scoring windows exactly as much as to plant readings.
14. **A surprising measurement is a reason to check the instrument, not to celebrate.** A
    sign error in one truth function made two conclusions more interesting than the
    corrected ones, and both were written up before it was caught. [flexisim]
15. **Two wrongs that agree are indistinguishable from two rights.** A model and a
    baseline built on the same formula cannot check each other. Bring in a route that does
    not share the mistake: a cruder estimator, a conservation law, an independently
    derived matrix, a zero rung that measures the instrument itself.
16. **A number computed from the model cannot check the model.** Where a design and its
    own prediction agree with each other and disagree with the machine, put the question
    to the machine. Three separate black-box defects were caught only by deploying and
    measuring; the verify round now DECIDES rather than checks. [flexisim]
17. **The instrument fails before the model does.** Check the readout, the units, the
    frame and the window before the physics. A wrong unit is not a modelling limit, and an
    honest module will report one with complete confidence.
18. **A common factor across plants that share no physics is a property of the code.**
    Three plants under-recovering their gain by the same 0.61–0.70 is what made a centring
    bug findable. [flexisim]
19. **Match the metric's support to the claim's.** A global metric cannot see a local
    poke; a local reading can be right while the number cannot resolve it. [flowsim]
20. **Compare at matched capacity and matched age, not at matched wall clock.** Same
    feature count, same training samples, same instances, one variable.
21. **A fix that improves everything has usually changed the measurement.** The signature
    of a real repair is that the cases it should NOT touch come back byte-identical.
22. **A difference measured with a broken instrument is not a finding.** The chain's
    "architecture reversal" was two numbers a few percent apart from models that could see
    4.6% of the period they were being asked about. [flexisim]

### Instruments and reporting

23. **If the question cannot be answered from the picture, build the number.** "Is it
    settled?" is a residual. "Can the window see the mode?" is a reach against a measured
    period. "How far does it swing?" is a band on the stage.
24. **A physics number must not move when a VIEWING control moves.** Normalise per solver
    step; index charts by solver steps, never by frames; split the frame's step budget at
    sample boundaries.
25. **"Not measured" and "exactly zero" are different states.** Zero renders as "perfectly
    steady" when it means "no reading" — and as "perfectly smooth" when it means "never
    measured", which let a selection rule deploy no correction at all.
26. **Zero is a limit, not an absence.** Never use a meaningful value as a sentinel. Use
    `null`. [flexisim]
27. **Report the unflattering diagnostic FIRST.** A rescued run says `limited — N cells
    held` before any stability verdict; a module states what it predicts it will achieve
    before it deploys.
28. **Keep the permanent debug dump.** A score has at least four explanations and cannot
    tell them apart. Log the whole configuration on every build and a post-mortem on every
    failure, so a phone report can be a paste rather than a description.
29. **Draw a prediction where it is ABOUT, not where it was issued.** Otherwise a perfect
    forecast looks wrong and a lagging one looks right.
30. **A page that describes its own behaviour in a second place will eventually describe
    the behaviour it used to have.** Generate the description from the thing.

### Models and commissioning

31. **A constant right for one plant must be RE-DERIVED for another.** The ridge, the loop
    gain, the scoring window, the lattice damping, the settle wait, the dither size, the
    shaper, the ILC gain. Every one of these has been carried over and been wrong.
32. **A threshold or a prior must be scaled to the quantity it acts on, not weak or small
    in the abstract.** An absolute floor on |θ| pruned every term in lattice units; a
    prior at P0 = 1e-6 against a regressor of 0.06 never updated and read as a broken
    regression; an effort weight of 0.1 against a plant energy of 7.28 did nothing at all.
33. **Success at cancelling a disturbance removes the evidence of it.** Commissioning
    needs a deliberately UNSHAPED, undithered, HELD probe — and a probe is never scored as
    production.
34. **Commission a model in the configuration it will RUN in, and lock last.** A
    correction changes both the model's inputs and its target: one locked model scored
    0.032 under the mode it trained in and 1.225 under another, a 38x spread with the
    weights frozen. [flexisim]
35. **A soft sensor inside a loop is positive feedback** unless it was trained over the
    operating points the loop will occupy. Dither the correction during commissioning;
    ~8% of accuracy is the price of a loop that converges instead of running to its clamp.
36. **A model fitted to a repeating stream scores by learning where in the cycle it is.**
    Modulate the command at an incommensurate rate and report on held-out states. A
    735-feature map scored beautifully on a repeating command and R² = −6.93 on an
    aperiodic one.
37. **A lag window must REACH the period of what it has to see.** A rich basis cannot
    substitute for a window too short to carry the phase — measured twice, and both times
    LINEAR features with the right window beat a 544-feature map with the wrong one at a
    third of the cost. Report the reach against the measured mode.
38. **A frozen standardisation belongs to the stream it was frozen on.** Guard it with a
    relative floor, a clamp, and ROLLING recalibration — a guard that latches off after
    its first success answers only an unrepresentative startup.
39. **Decompose the error into BIAS and OSCILLATION.** Different mechanisms, different
    fixes, and one RMS hides both: a unit-sum convolution cannot move where a move ENDS,
    and a quasi-static correction cannot cancel a resonance. A loop needs the bias, and
    can only null what its instrument can resolve.
40. **Learn the parameters that have no closed form; compute the ones that do.** [ngrc]
41. **Directional forgetting has measured NEUTRAL five independent times here.** Default
    off.
42. **Selection: among the candidates within 5% of the best MEASURED score, take the
    cheapest — or the smoothest.** A weighted sum of two incommensurable quantities is a
    preference dressed as a result. The band belongs on the IMPROVEMENT, never on the
    residual, or "do nothing" falls inside it and wins on effort. Break exact ties on the
    next criterion, never on loop order.
43. **A better optimiser on a wrong model buys nothing.** 1.13x → 2.84x came entirely from
    fixing the identification with the optimiser untouched.
44. **A sub-task started once can fail; a sub-task restarted whenever its result is
    missing can only loop.** Every "if the result exists move on, else start it" needs a
    started-flag, or a failure becomes an infinite commissioning.
45. **Quiet is "it has not moved", not "it is moving slowly."** A per-sample rate test
    called a first-order settle quiet with 40% of the travel still to come. Measure the
    TRAVEL over a window, and seed the scale from the signal.

### Physics and geometry

46. **The boundary is where the SCHEME puts it, not where the loop bounds are** — half a
    cell out from the last cell centre. Pin it against the two plausible wrong
    alternatives.
47. **Every term of a projected quantity must be PROJECTED.** A joint-to-tool DISTANCE is
    not the lever for an error measured transverse to the last link: they agree at a
    straight pose, differ by a third folded, and have OPPOSITE SIGNS past a right angle.
48. **A bent link does not merely move its own tip, it TILTS everything downstream.** That
    term needs the tip SLOPE and is levered by the whole downstream reach; omitting it
    from the chain's tool error cost a factor of 1.44, more than both gearbox wind-ups
    combined.
49. **A sign convention is only free to change where every consumer is EVEN in it.** A
    ReLU basis downstream is not.
50. **Declare reads and writes; the solver refuses two operators writing one field in a
    stage.** Coupling must be stated, never implied by call order.

### Platform traps, each of which has bitten at least once

51. **Silence is a failure mode — refuse to build.** A WGSL reserved word made every
    shader fail to compile, asynchronously and without throwing, and the sim ran at full
    speed producing zeros.
52. **A more specific CSS rule wins only the properties it NAMES.** A host's
    `button { min-width:110px }` beat a bootstrap that never named min-width. And `hidden`
    is only a UA `display:none` — any class rule setting `display` beats it.
53. **WGSL `vec3<f32>` is size 12, align 16**, so an `f32` after one lands at offset 108,
    not 112. Write the offsets out, computed. Three times; only the parity check saw it.
54. **`Plotly.react` compares data BY REFERENCE** — arrays mutated in place are a no-op.
    Give every container an explicit height AND make it visible before drawing into it.
55. **A hidden canvas has no size, and 0/0 is NaN, which passes every bounds check.**
56. **Never destroy a buffer with a `mapAsync` in flight.** Teardown must be awaitable, a
    rebuild during a rebuild queued, and a frame's backend access guarded at ONE choke
    point.
57. **A rebuild that can throw needs `try/finally`**, or the busy flag stays set for ever
    and the tab is dead with the rejection invisible.
58. **A fix that makes state survive an operation makes every not-rebuilt dependency of
    that state reachable for the first time.**
59. **State what is NOT built, and the measurement that would change the answer** — a
    decision has to be falsifiable, not permanent.

## Current state

Everything below is what is TRUE NOW. How each of it got here — the measurements, the
wrong turns, the numbers behind every claim — is in `docs/history/`, which the Docs
viewer renders like any other markdown in the repo.

### The shared platform

**`index.html`** — the hub: header, debug console, docs viewer, and launchers for
`NGRC`, `FLOW`, `FLEX` and `DOCS`.

**Debug console** (`console-boot.js`, shared by every page, loaded FIRST in `<head>`,
dependency-free). Captures `console.*`, uncaught errors with stack and file:line, and
unhandled rejections; persists to localStorage so a white-screen crash is recoverable;
badge counts errors and warnings; Copy all, Clear, a live JS eval box, a build line. It
injects its UI into the HOST page, so it states its own geometry rather than inheriting
one (rule 52). The buffer is per ORIGIN, not per page.

**Stale-page detection.** On load `version.json` is fetched `no-store`; a newer server
build raises a red banner. `reloadFresh()` re-fetches every script in the generated
`modules.json` with `{cache:"reload"}` before reloading, because a `?v=` on the document
does not reach `import './x.js'`. An uncaught error matching the browser's wording for a
module-export mismatch raises the banner itself.

**Docs viewer.** Renders every `.md` in `docs-manifest.json` with self-hosted marked.
Directory selector; ◆ CLAUDE context vs Docs; opens `CLAUDE.md` by default.

### FlowSim — `flowsim.html` on `lib/lattsim/`

A GPU lattice-field physics engine. The lattice is the physical representation: no
particles, and a moving mass is a pattern in the density and momentum fields transported
between neighbouring cells.

- **Architecture.** Simulation → Lattice / Fields / Materials / PhysicsOperators /
  Boundaries / Solver / Backends. Indexing `x + Nx·(y + Ny·z)` everywhere; fields
  structure-of-arrays; anything advanced in time is double-buffered.
- **Two backends.** WGSL compute shaders in production; a CPU reference implementing the
  same equations from the same constants (`d3q19.js` is the single source of truth and the
  WGSL is GENERATED from it). The reference runs the analytic checks in Node, serves the
  page where WebGPU is absent, and is compared cell-by-cell against the GPU where one
  exists.
- **One collision configuration ships:** TRT with ω⁻ pinned for stability, plus the
  Smagorinsky sub-grid model. BGK and TRT-at-Λ=3/16 stay in the LIBRARY because the
  analytic verification needs both.
- **The run cannot crash.** Density clamped away from zero, velocity clamped at 0.35, and
  any population still non-finite replaced by the equilibrium at the sanitised moments —
  so a NaN is caught in the cell where it appears and never streams. The reduction counts
  clamped cells and the verdict reads `limited — N cell(s) held` BEFORE any stability
  verdict.
- **Operators.** `lbm.js` (D3Q19 fluid, Guo forcing, `stir()`, an EOS pressure force with
  a selectable effective sound speed), `scalar.js` (passive scalar, one-way coupled),
  `elastic.js` + `frame.js` (see FlexiSim).
- **Tabs.** *Simulate* — channel+obstacle (cylinder or sphere), Poiseuille, lid-driven
  cavity, dye; resolution clamped to the device's reported binding limit, τ 0.5001–2.5,
  inlet speed 0.005–0.35, wall speed, lid frequency, steps/frame, slice controls; 2D slice
  on any backend, raymarched volume on WebGPU; live mass, momentum, density range, max|u|,
  MLUPS, per-step residual, Re, Re_cell against the per-model ceiling, and a named
  verdict. Dragging the slice stirs the fluid. *Verify* — the analytic checks in-browser
  against the live backend. *Architecture* — the design note.
- **Probe and chart.** One cell over time, a 16-byte readback, charted in SOLVER STEPS.
- **Soft sensor.** Two points on one lattice: the probe is the sensor, a second marker the
  target, with an optional second sensor. Lifecycle idle → calibrating → training →
  estimating/locked; frozen standardisation with a relative floor, a clamp and rolling
  recalibration; `steadyTarget` reported instead of a meaningless ratio.
- **Field reconstruction** on the dye scene: wall sensors reading velocity and pressure
  only rebuild the whole concentration slice through one shared-covariance model.

### NGRC playground — `ngrc.html` on `lib/ngrc/`

Four tabs, each framed as NGRC against a common alternative.

- **① Chaotic systems.** Seven systems with per-system dt, measured λ_max, embedding, poly
  order and ridge. Four models learn from one stream — NGRC, an ESN, an MLP, a linear ARX
  — then Dream free-runs all four while reality keeps running. Valid time in Lyapunov
  times with a phase-tolerant threshold; a 250-sample washout gates training and a
  5-sample re-entry washout runs on wake. Noise slider, speed slider, batch mode,
  pause/resume, manual training lifecycle, and an Experiment summary under a black-box
  contract (baselines and protocol fully specified, NGRC's internals withheld and stated
  as withheld; a leak audit greps the text).
- **② Soft sensor.** A deliberately nonlinear motor/load plant — Stribeck friction,
  backlash, a hardening spring, cogging, encoder quantisation, with plant-health counters
  asserted so it cannot be silently linearised. Baselines: an exact Kalman filter, an
  engineering Kalman filter, the algebraic shortcut, PLS frozen and adaptive, persistence.
  A manual-mode bit is a fifth signal. A +1 s preview is a second target of the same
  block, gated at 2500 trained pairs.
- **③ Finger trace.** Amber NGRC ghost against a k-NN analogue, an ESN, an MLP and a raw
  AFM trace; a 25-rung direct-multi-horizon ladder behind a 0.2–20 s slider; path-lock
  after ~8 s; multi-stroke doodles with pen lifts first-class; autopilot; freeze.
- **④ Anti-slosh axis.** Six machines on the same command, each differing from the one
  above by exactly one thing. One off-centre gauge is the only liquid instrument. Health
  check runs an UNSHAPED probe, queued to a move boundary and followed by a settling
  dwell, feeding a vote-of-three fault panel with independent threshold tests.

### FlexiSim — `flexisim.html` on `lib/flexisim/` + `lib/lattsim/` + `lib/blackbox/`

Compliant serial chains. Joints are LUMPED nonlinear elements (gearbox stiffness,
backlash, Stribeck friction, ratio, motor inertia); LINKS are lattice elastic solids, one
small dense lattice per link in its own body frame. Every mass property is INTEGRATED
FROM THE LATTICE. Six tabs. **The end application is CNC contouring, so ③ Path is the tab
that matches it** — the point-to-point tabs measure a different question.

- **① Move** — a single-joint hybrid arm. Commissioning runs inside the frame loop (pose
  holds, then a deliberately excited decay). Four correction modes: ① open loop, ② the
  identified compliance evaluated at the COMMAND with a lead of one servo time constant,
  ③ a closed loop on the soft sensor's estimate, ④ a learned dynamic filter fitted to an
  iteratively refined per-phase correction across three bracketing moves. Plus a measured
  ZVD shaper, a boxcar jerk limit, a SETTLE dwell in periods of the measured ring, a drive
  rating giving torque, acceleration and speed limits from one torque-speed curve, and a
  labelled deflection magnification. **Compare** scores every mode over its own settled
  window; **Auto-tune** runs the sequence and LOCKS THE SENSOR LAST, under the correction
  actually selected. The stage draws program and encoder at true scale and the tool
  magnified against the program, inside a sweep band.
- **② Chain** — a 2R chain with computed torque evaluated at the commanded pose. The
  coupling chart splits the elbow's inertial load into the shoulder's doing and its own.
  Link 2 hangs off link 1's DRAWN tip, position and slope. Its reference is
  amplitude-modulated at the golden ratio; the scoring window is three move periods and
  the loop gain is derived from the move period. Two tool sensors — whole-arm and
  elbow-only — trained side by side at matched capacity and matched window reach.
- **③ Path** — CONTOURING, which is what the end application is: a 2R arm tracing a
  closed toolpath (circle, rounded rectangle or square) at a look-ahead feedrate profile
  with the corner rule and the acceleration ELLIPSE. The deviation is split into CONTOUR
  error (normal — the part is the wrong shape) and LAG (along — the part is right and the
  cycle is slower), and only the first is a defect; energy is reported as BOTH copper loss
  ∫τ² and mechanical work ∫|τω|, and direction changes are counted as TRAVEL past the
  joint's own lost motion. Backlash is on here and nowhere else, because this is the only
  tab whose metrics can see it. Four corrections: ① none, ② the wind-up model τ/K, ③ a
  per-joint compliance identified on ONE SLOW LAP and then locked, ④ ITERATIVE LEARNING —
  a correction table indexed by arc length on the part, updated between laps with a lead
  of one position-loop time constant and a zero-phase filter, ⑤ THE PILOT (`lib/pilot/`) —
  commissioned once from noise by one button, deploys only if its own verify round
  measured an improvement on the machine, then cuts programs it has never seen (6.2× on
  the rectangle — BELOW ILC's fourteen-lap converged figure, first part, fewer reversals,
  36% less copper — 7.0× on the circle). The pilot does not even need the KINEMATICS:
  fed only held tracker points during commissioning it fits the direct inverse
  (x,y)→commands itself (1.2e-4 rad holdout from 180 points), and holding real path
  points that learned map beats the analytic ik() 23–44× statically — the analytic
  kinematics commands the drawing, the learned map commands the machine, droop and
  wind-up included (brick 40; `test/pilot/ikfree.test.mjs`). That system ships as
  ⑥ FULLY LEARNED (Commission ⑥: gather held points → fit the inverse → pilot on top,
  refs from the learned map, same refusal shape as ⑤) and ⑦ FULLY LEARNED + ILC (a
  separate PathILC on the learned chain, tool error mapped through the learned routing):
  measured circle 5.9e-2 → 1.14e-3 by lap 14 (within 28% of the analytic ILC@15) and
  rectangle → 1.27e-2, twice BELOW the analytic ILC's converged 2.53e-2 (brick 41).
  ⑤+④ stacks the same table on the ANALYTIC pilot (circle 1.03e-3, rectangle 1.30e-2
  by lap 14) — and beside ⑦ that is the finding: iteration erases the difference
  between knowing the kinematics and having learned them (brick 42). At the softest
  compliance sliders two more lessons shipped (brick 44): ⑥'s gather settles until the
  tracker is QUIET rather than for a fixed count, its truth routing is an AFFINE
  observer — G(cmd)·(tool − fwd(cmd)), both learned halves evaluated at the command,
  because a nonlinear map of the fast variable breaks the LTI-ness the QP needs
  (verify 0.48× → 5.02× at K 0.25/E 0.03) — and every ILC table carries a MONOTONE
  SAFEGUARD (backoff, settling dwell, freeze after 3) whose measured endpoint is
  exactly the continuous open loop: a soft gearbox's table pumped to 5.25 unguarded.
  The pilot's forecast basis stays LINEAR by measurement: the NGRC quadratic
  expansion loses held-out at every lead on this plant (to R² −22); the nonlinearity
  lives in the degree-7 geometry map.
  **WHERE THE PILOT STANDS ACROSS SIX PLANTS THAT SHARE NO PHYSICS**, which is the only
  honest way to state an agnosticism claim: the 2R arm 5.96× / 6.91×; a quadruple tank
  1.47×, with its non-minimum-phase configuration correctly REFUSED; a three-zone
  extruder barrel refused (0.94×); the Wood–Berry column LOST (72.08 against the
  published BLT's 51.95); a cold mill AGC refused (0.42×); and the **EMPS servo axis**
  — a real machine, real data, `test/pilot/emps.test.mjs` — 4.8×, which is FOURTH OF SIX
  controllers on that page. The rig is validated twice against the hardware (our IDIM-LS
  recovers the published M/Fv/Fc/OF to 0.8%; the closed loop reproduces the recorded
  encoder to 1.6 µm rms and the recorded tracking error to 0.03%), and on it a velocity
  feedforward is worth 15.2×, a hand-tuned ILC 119× and an inverse-dynamics feedforward
  at the published parameters 275×. **The reason is the plant, not a defect** — that
  machine has a four-parameter closed form and its authors published it, which is the
  anti-slosh tab's rule from the other side: learn the parameters with no closed form,
  compute the ones that have one.
  TWO DEFECTS CAME OUT OF IT AND NEITHER IS FIXED, because they are one piece of work.
  (i) `_deriveCadence` floors the measured rise at 200 steps; a 1 kHz servo is the first
  plant fast enough to trip it (measured rise 17), and the floor costs 3.2× (4.79×
  against 15.55× at the measured rise). (ii) THE VERIFY GATE RANKS THOSE CONFIGURATIONS
  BACKWARDS — as the cadence improves, delivered benefit rises 4.79 → 15.55× while the
  gate's estimate falls 28.68 → 1.04× — so lowering the floor alone would take the
  machine from 4.79× to REFUSED. And on the same axis with its own feedforward on, the
  gate said 2.03× for a deployment that measured **0.23×, i.e. 4.3× worse**: the first
  time the harm has been measured on the machine rather than inferred. The gate scores a
  filtered-noise scribble whose timescale comes from the position box and the declared
  rate limits rather than from the plant; it has to score a regime the machine will
  actually run, and gate on the WORST of several.
  **Sweep feedrate**
  runs the whole ladder and tabulates the trade. The arm is drawn at TRUE geometry; the error trail
  is the exaggerated object, pushed out along the path normal only.
- **④ Black box** — `lib/blackbox/`, a controller GIVEN NOTHING: a scalar command it can
  read, a scalar correction it can add, unlabelled signals, and a tracker during
  COMMISSIONING ONLY. It determines its own timescale from a quiet-detected step test;
  identifies the plant from a probe taken while HELD and the disturbance while RUNNING;
  designs a preview FIR and a box-constrained QP; then a VERIFY ROUND puts every candidate
  on the machine — including a ZERO rung that measures the disturbance map's own bias so
  the others can be divided by it — and deploys the best MEASURED one, or nothing.
  Corrections are linearly interpolated between grid samples, never held. It locks its own
  soft sensor at the end.
- **⑤ Verify** — the closed forms run in this browser against the same modules.
- **⑥ Architecture** — the design note.

### Libraries

| Directory | What it is |
|---|---|
| `lib/lattsim/` | The general lattice engine — lattice, fields, materials, operators (`lbm`, `scalar`, `elastic`, `frame`), solver, WebGPU + CPU backends, renderers. Named `lattsim` deliberately: it is not the fluid page. |
| `lib/ngrc/` | The TC_NGRC port, with golden-vector parity tests. |
| `lib/probesense/` | Soft-sensing a field from one point in it. Fed numbers; knows no physics. |
| `lib/flexisim/` | `joint`, `link`, `arm`, `arm2r`, `armnr` (recursive Newton–Euler), `tipsensor`, `chainsensor`, `compliance`, `compensator`, plus contouring: `toolpath` (geometry + feedrate profile), `contour` (the metrics), `pathilc` (learning over laps). |
| `lib/blackbox/` | A controller given nothing about the plant, plus `qp.js`. Imports nothing from `lib/flexisim/` — the boundary is the directory. Verified on three plants sharing no physics. |
| `lib/pilot/` | Route–limit–run–deploy: settle → probe → excite → fit → verify → deploy-or-refuse, on a receding-horizon box-constrained QP. Imports only `../blackbox/qp.js`. |

## Versioning

`stamp-version.sh` runs **before each commit**. It:

- Sets the build number to `git rev-list --count HEAD + 1` (the number of the
  commit being created).
- Writes a UTC timestamp.
- Stamps both `index.html` (the `// __STAMP__` line) and `version.json`.
- Regenerates `docs-manifest.json`.

Run it, then commit, so the shipped commit and its version number match.

## Conventions

- **Self-contained / no external CDNs.** Everything is served from this origin, so the
  page works offline and is not at the mercy of a blocked host.
- Vanilla JS, no build tooling beyond the shell script.
- Keep the console bootstrap first in `<head>` and dependency-free.
- It injects its UI into the HOST page, so it states its own geometry rather than
  inheriting one — see rule 52 and `docs/history/flowsim.md` for the measurement.

## Where the history lives

`docs/history/flowsim.md`, `docs/history/ngrc.md` and `docs/history/flexisim.md` hold the
measurement record: what was tried, what it measured, what was rejected and why. They are
not specifications — where they and this file disagree, this file is what ships. They are
kept because they have repeatedly stopped the same mistake being made twice, and because
several of them record a later brick OVERTURNING an earlier one, which is the most useful
thing in them.
